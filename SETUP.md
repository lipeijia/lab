# Setup Instructions

## Manual Steps to Complete

Since GitHub CLI is not available, please follow these steps manually:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new)
2. Create a new repository named `my-blog`
3. Make it public (required for GitHub Pages)
4. Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. Add Remote and Push

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/lipeijia/my-blog.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Save the settings

### 4. Verify Deployment

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see a deployment workflow running
3. Once complete, your site will be available at: `https://lipeijia.github.io/my-blog/`

### 5. Set up Obsidian

1. Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
2. Open Obsidian and select "Open folder as vault"
3. Navigate to your project folder and select the `obsidian-notes` folder
4. Start writing your blog posts in `obsidian-notes/blog/`

## Content Workflow

### Writing New Posts

1. Create a new markdown file in `obsidian-notes/blog/`
2. Use the template in `obsidian-notes/templates/blog-post-template.md`
3. When ready to publish, run: `node sync-content.js blog`
4. Commit and push changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Add new blog post" && git push`

### Updating Configuration

If you need to change your GitHub username or other settings:

1. Update `docusaurus.config.js`:
   - Change `organizationName` to your GitHub username
   - Update `url` to match your GitHub Pages URL
   - Update `baseUrl` if needed

2. Update `README.md` with your GitHub username

3. Update the GitHub Actions workflow if needed (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

## Testing Locally

### Start development server:
```bash
npm start
```

### Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Serve built site:
```bash
npm run serve
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
- Make sure all authors are defined in `blog/authors.yml`
- Make sure all tags are defined in `blog/tags.yml`
- Use `<!-- truncate -->` markers in blog posts

### GitHub Pages Not Working
- Ensure repository is public
- Check that GitHub Actions are enabled
- Verify the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Check the Actions tab for error messages

### npm ci Failures
If you encounter `npm ci` errors in GitHub Actions:

1. **Node version mismatch**: The workflow uses Node v22 to match your local environment
2. **Alternative workflow**: Use `.github/workflows/deploy-simple.yml` which uses `npm install` instead
3. **Manual fix**: Delete and recreate `package-lock.json` with `rm package-lock.json && npm install`

### Using the Alternative Workflow
If the main workflow continues to fail, you can:

1. Disable the main workflow:
   - Rename `deploy.yml` to `deploy.yml.disabled`
2. The `deploy-simple.yml` workflow will take over
3. This uses `npm install` instead of `npm ci` (more reliable but slower)

## Next Steps

1. Complete the GitHub setup above
2. Write your first blog post in Obsidian
3. Customize the theme and styling
4. Add more features as needed

Happy blogging! ðŸŽ‰
