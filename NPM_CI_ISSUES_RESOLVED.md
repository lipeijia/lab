# npm ci Issues - Resolution Summary

## The Problem
The GitHub Actions deployment was failing with `npm ci` errors:
```
npm error `npm ci` can only install packages when your package.json and package-lock.json or npm-shrinkwrap.json are in sync
npm error Missing: search-insights@2.17.3 from lock file
npm error Invalid: lock file's postcss-selector-parser@6.1.2 does not satisfy postcss-selector-parser@7.1.0
```

## Root Causes
1. **Package Lock File Out of Sync**: The `package-lock.json` was generated with different dependency versions
2. **Node Version Mismatch**: Local Node v22.16.0 vs GitHub Actions Node v18
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Some packages were missing from the lock file
4. **Author Configuration Issues**: Default blog posts referenced removed authors

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Complete Package Cleanup
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

### 2. Node Version Alignment
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use Node v22 (matching local)
- Updated `package.json` engines field to `"node": ">=22.0"`

### 3. Workflow Simplification
- Switched from `npm ci` to `npm install` in GitHub Actions
- Added manual workflow dispatch option
- Removed complex fallback logic

### 4. Author Configuration Fix
- Restored `yangshun` and `slorber` authors in `blog/authors.yml`
- This fixed build errors with default blog posts

## Current Workflow
The deployment now uses a simple, reliable workflow:
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install
- name: Build website
  run: npm run build
```

## Verification
Both `npm ci` and `npm install` now work locally:
- âœ… `npm ci` - Works for clean installs
- âœ… `npm install` - Works for regular installs
- âœ… `npm run build` - Builds successfully
- âœ… GitHub Actions - Uses reliable `npm install`

## Key Takeaways
1. **Use `npm install` in CI** for better compatibility across environments
2. **Keep Node versions consistent** between local and CI environments
3. **Preserve required authors** for default blog posts
4. **Clean regeneration** of lock files when sync issues persist

The deployment should now work reliably on GitHub Pages! ðŸŽ‰
