# Welcome to My Blog

Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post using the Docusaurus + Obsidian workflow.

<!-- truncate -->

## About This Blog

This blog is built using:
- **Docusaurus** - A modern static site generator
- **Obsidian** - For writing and organizing content
- **GitHub Pages** - For hosting
- **GitHub Actions** - For automatic deployment

## Writing Workflow

1. I write my posts in Obsidian using this dedicated vault
2. When ready to publish, I copy the markdown files to the Docusaurus blog folder
3. Push to GitHub and the site automatically deploys

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:
- Technology
- Development
- Personal projects
- Thoughts and ideas

Stay tuned for more content!
